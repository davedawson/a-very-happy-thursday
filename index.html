	<!-- 
		<p class="lead-in">"Let's go and see everybody," said Pooh. "Because when you've been walking in the wind for miles, and you suddenly go into somebody's house, and he says, 'Hallo,Pooh, you're just in time for a little smackerel of something,' and you are, then it's what I call a Friendly Day."</p>
		<div class="col1">
			<p>Piglet thought that they ought to have a Reason for going to see everybody, like Looking for Small or Organizing an Expotition, if Pooh could think of something.</p>
			<p>Pooh could.</p>
			<p>"We'll go because it's Thursday," he said, "and we'll go to wish everybody a Very Happy Thursday.
		Come on, Piglet."</p>
			<p>They got up; and when Piglet had sat down again, because he didn't know the wind was so strong, and had been helped up by Pooh, they started off. They went to Pooh's house first, and luckily Pooh was at home just as they got there, so he asked them in, and they had some, and then they went on to Kanga's house, holding on to each other, and shouting, "isn't it?" and "What?" and "I can't hear."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col2">
			<p>By the time they got to Kanga's house they were so buffeted that they stayed to lunch. Just at first it seemed rather cold outside afterwards, so they pushed on to Rabbit's as quickly as they could.</p>
			<p>"We've come to wish you a Very Happy Thursday," said Pooh, when he had gone in and out once or twice just to make sure that he could get out again.
	"Why, what's going to happen on Thursday?" asked Rabbit, and when Pooh had explained, and Rabbit, whose life was made up of Important Things, said "Oh, I thought you'd really come about something," they sat down for a little ... and by-and-by Pooh and Piglet went on again. The wind was behind them now,
	so they didn't have to shout.</p>
			<p>"Rabbit's clever," said Pooh thoughtfully.</p>
			<p>"Yes," said Piglet, "Rabbits clever."</p>
			<p>"And he has Brain."</p>
			<p>"Yes," said Piglet, "Rabbit has Brain."</p>
			<p>There was a long silence.</p>
			<p>"I suppose," said Pooh, "that that's why he never understands anything."</p>
